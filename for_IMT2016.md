## Problem Statement ID: 2016_owncloud
Host owncloud on your laptop

Mentor: [@vik-y](https://github.com/vik-y)

### Description
Use your github student starter pack to get digital ocean credits. Using those credits host a 512 MB ram instance on digital ocean. On that instance install openvpn. Now you have to install owncloud on your own laptop (not the digital ocean vm) and it should be accessible on your digitla ocean IP.

For example - If your digital ocean IP is : 139.59.5.222 then your owncloud should be publicly accessible at http://139.59.5.222/owncloud

Hint: You have to connect your laptop to the VPN hosted on digital ocean. Then you have to install owncloud on your laptop and setup a reverse proxy server on your digital ocean vm.
