Web Based Mass Mailer

Mentor : [@arkokoley](https://github.com/arkokoley)

### Description
Use your GitHub student starter pack to activate your SendGrid account. Use that account to create a mailing function in python/php/ruby which given a list/array of email addresses, a subject string and a body string will send emails to all the listed addresses, the given body of email with the specified subject.

Once that is done, use Flask(python) / Silex(PHP) / Sinatra (Ruby) to build a web page, which contains a HTML form asking for:

    A set of email addresses separated by ','
    Subject of the email
    Body of the email

When you submit, your mailing function should be called and the email should be send to the mentioned addresses.

Host this on Digital Ocean using your Starter pack credits.
